## To-do app

Here are some useful features you can add to your todo app:

1. **Delete a Todo**  
   Add a button next to each todo to remove it from the list.

2. **Mark as Completed**  
   Allow users to mark a todo as done (for example, by clicking on it or with a checkbox).

3. **Edit a Todo**  
   Let users edit the text of an existing todo.

4. **Persist Todos**  
   Save todos in the browser’s local storage so they don’t disappear when you refresh the page.

5. **Add Due Dates**  
   Allow users to set a due date for each todo.

6. **Filter Todos**  
   Add options to show all, only completed, or only active todos.

7. **Clear All Todos**  
   Add a button to remove all todos at once.

8. **Reorder Todos**  
   Allow users to drag and drop to reorder the list.
